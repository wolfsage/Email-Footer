So, I've been pretty lazy (alternately, busy with other things), but
I've made a number of commits to Rubric lately.  By the way, you can
check Rubric out here:

  http://svn.codesimply.com/projects/rubric/

The largest change has been in creating Rubric::CLI, which will be the
foundation for a new "rubric" command that will do things like "create
users" and "approve users" and "update db schema" and "install new
Rubric" and so on.

Someone is working on the first non-trivial Rubric::Entry::Formatter
plugin, and I am excited by the prospect.  I need to write some of those
myself!

My need for Rubric-for-images is getting critical, so hopefully I'll be
talking about how I'll do that soon, too.

Contributions, complaints, or ideas for how to make the CLI most useful
are welcome.
